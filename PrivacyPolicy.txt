Last Updated: April 19, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how Spy (the "Bot"), operated by Swod ("Bot Owner", "we", or "us"), collects, uses, and protects information obtained from users ("you" or "User") through your interaction with the Bot on Discord. By using the Bot, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please discontinue use of the Bot. üòä

1. Information We Collect

We may collect the following types of information when you interact with the Bot:

User Data: Information such as your Discord user ID, username, and any messages or commands you send to the Bot in Discord servers or direct messages.
Server Data: Information about the Discord servers the Bot is added to, such as server ID, channel IDs, and member roles (only as necessary to provide Bot functionality).
Usage Data: Technical information about how you interact with the Bot, such as command usage, timestamps, and error logs.

We do not collect sensitive personal information such as email addresses, real names, or payment details unless explicitly provided by you in a context where such information is necessary (e.g., support requests).

2. How We Use Your Information

The information we collect is used to:

Provide and improve the Bot‚Äôs functionality, such as processing commands and delivering responses. ‚öôÔ∏è
Monitor and troubleshoot issues to ensure the Bot operates smoothly.
Analyze usage patterns to enhance user experience and develop new features.
Respond to support requests or inquiries you may have.

We do not use your data for marketing purposes or share it with third parties except as described below.

3. Data Sharing and Disclosure

We may share your information in the following circumstances:

Service Providers: We may use third-party services (e.g., hosting providers or analytics tools) to operate the Bot. These providers will only access data necessary to perform their functions and are bound by confidentiality obligations.
Legal Requirements: We may disclose your information if required by law, such as in response to a court order or legal process.
Bot Functionality: Certain features (e.g., public leaderboards or shared commands) may display your user ID or username to other users within the same Discord server, but only if you actively use those features.

4. Data Storage and Security

Your data is stored securely using industry-standard measures to protect against unauthorized access, loss, or misuse. üîí
Data is retained only for as long as necessary to provide the Bot‚Äôs services or comply with legal obligations. For example, command logs may be deleted after a set period (e.g., 30 days) unless needed for troubleshooting or legal purposes.
If the Bot is removed from a server, we will delete server-specific data within a reasonable timeframe unless otherwise required.

5. Your Rights and Choices

As a User, you have the following options:

Opt-Out: You can stop using the Bot at any time or remove it from your Discord server.
Data Access: You may contact us to request information about the data we have collected about you. We will respond within a reasonable timeframe, subject to verification of your identity.
Data Deletion: You may request deletion of your data by contacting us, and we will comply unless we are required to retain it for legal reasons.

Please note that Discord‚Äôs own privacy practices govern data processed by Discord itself (e.g., your account information). You can review Discord‚Äôs Privacy Policy at https://discord.com/privacy.

6. Children‚Äôs Privacy

The Bot is not intended for use by individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we will take steps to delete it. üõë
